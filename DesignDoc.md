## Checklist (delete once complete)

To include:

-  [ ] the list of [data structures](#data-structures), and the rationale behind each.  
-  [ ] the list of [member/free-standing functions](#functions); include a brief description for this function if it’s NOT straightforward, e.g., a simple accessor. For some functions, you should consider to describe it in pseudocode, For example, if you choose to generate a visual representation of the BFS tree.
-  [ ] briefly describe each [team member’s main contributions](#contributions).

(No need to include the BFS and shortest-path algorithms. Simply referring to the corresponding slides will suffice.)
