# DesignDoc

## Data Structures

- the list of data structures, and the rationale behind each.  

## Functions

- the list of member/free-standing functions; include a brief description for this function if it’s NOT straightforward, e.g., a simple accessor.
- for some functions, you should consider to describe it in pseudocode, For example, if you choose to generate a visual representation of the BFS tree.  

(No need to include the BFS and shortest-path algorithms. Simply referring to the corresponding slides will suffice.)

## Contributions

- briefly describe each team member’s main contributions.
